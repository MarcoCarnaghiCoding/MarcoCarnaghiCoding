<p align="left">👷‍♂️ Hi! My name is  Marco Carnaghi, and I am an Electronic Engineer graduated from the  National University of Mar del Plata in the province of Buenos Aires, Argentina. Currently, I work as the PhD Researcher and Assistant Professor Department of Electronic and Computation Engineer of the National University of Mar del Plata, Argentina. <br><br>🌱 However, I am looking to initiate a new phase in my professional career in the challenging world of Data oriented projects. Consequently, I am interested in challenging myself by collaborating on projects on a variety of topics. My research experience has taught me to be a fast self-leaner, and to seek and identify potential solutions to different problems.</p>

<p align="left">👩‍💻🔭 Recently, I was proposed to start collaborating in a new project of my current research line (Direct Current Microgrids operation) to come up with novel strategies for distributed energy. I'm very excited about this project because I'm considering using technologies such as Multi-Agent Systems and Reinforce Learning to deal with the distributed decision taking process in the system. I know I will have to learn a lot about those topics but I'm willing to put on the effort.</p>
